    "> Hi Michael,\n",
    "\n",
    "> In general, numba is not going to speed up calculations that involve numpy built-in methods (unless they are things like np.exp, np.sin, np.cos) or array slicing. It works best if you have unrolled any vectorization into explicited nested loops and operate on arrays element-by-element. If you go that route, check to see if you can get the code to compile using @jit(nopython=True), which would be indicitive of numba being able to translate the code to llvm IR without using python objects (which tend to slow things down). I've also had a lot of success lately parallelizing numba code using threading if you aren't dealing with any python objects. If you can compile in nopython mode, then you can also specify:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "@jit(nopython=True, nogil=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> and use a ThreadPool to chop up the work, using something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "> http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/0.19.1/user/examples.html?highlight=nogil#multi-threading\n",
    "\n",
    "> it's undocumented, but for simple stuff you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```python\n",
    "> from multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool\n",
    "> pool = ThreadPool(processes=nthreads)\n",
    "> results = pool.map(func, arg)\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "> It has the same API as the multiprocessing pool, and for embarassingly parallel tasks that don't have possible race conditions, it works quite nicely depending on the overhead involved in spawning off the task relative to the cost of the task. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Also, make sure you're using the latest version of numba since it's getting better rapidly. I'm not sure if you'll be able to call np.zeros_like in a numba-ized method in nopython mode, although you might. If not, you can pass in the results array as an argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Hope that helps. I can't think of any sneaky vectorization tricks in pure-numpy off the top of my head to make your calculation faster. Let me know if you have any other questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Josh"

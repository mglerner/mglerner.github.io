I'll be blogging a bit more regularly through my sabbatical as a bit of self-documentation.  This wek, I'm churning through more Coursera materials for bioinformatics-directed data science. On to [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing/home/welcome)!

I'm picking and choosing courses, and skipping the first two in the sequence. I don't expect to skip as much of the actual material in this course as in the last one, but let's see. I'm watching all of the videos at 2.0x, which keeps them interesting. I AM SO EXCITED!

Because I'm a very modern human, I'm going to be keeping all of my class notes in Jupyter Notebooks. I love the fact that the instructors are familiar with reasonably modern Python. In one of the examples, I wrote my own version because theirs seemed outdated. Then, immediately in the video, they rewrote it with the `collections` module. Yay! They still have some old habits (`%matplotlib inline`, explicit conversion to float, etc.), but pretty good. If only they used fstrings, though!

I'm watching at 2.0x speed and coding along with them. Definitely fun for some perverse reason.

Question: from the Sequencing errors and base qualities lecture: does the base caller use the previous snapshots to adjust the called value and the uncertainty? Writing a base caller might be really interesting.
